> _Report compiled, beginning report_

Cradle is an iteration whose magic system makes it unique in the number of
people who ascend from it. Most notable are the _Original Court of 7_, _Ozriel_,
and much of the founding _Reaper_ division, including _Wei Shi Lindon Arelius_,
_Yerin Arelius_, _Akura Mercy_, and _Ziel of the Wastelands_.

The denizens of Cradle generate something called _Madra_, which is more akin to
a spiritual energy that powers all of the magic systems on Cradle. Each denizen
can move this Madra through a system of channels in their body they, quite
unoriginally, call _Madra Channels_.

On Cradle many different things generate _Vital Aura_, commonly shortened to
just _Aura_. Aura is a spiritual energy, akin to Madra with one key difference:
it inherits properties dependent upon its source. Earth Aura would be stubborn,
immovable, and tough. Water Aura would be fluid, fleeting, and strong in motion.
Fire Aura would be destructive, hot, but also with elements light.

_Sacred Artists_ are people who practice cycling their spiritual core while
pulling in Vital Aura from a source around them. They then push this Vital Aura
through their Madra channels. Over time their own Madra starts to take on
properties of the Aura they cycle, and they can thus utilize techniques powered
by the specific properties of their new Madra type. Through careful cultivation of their Madra, Sacred Artists progress through various ranks of power, such as _Copper_, _Iron_, _Jade_, _Low Gold_, _High Gold_, _Truegold_, _Underlord_, _Overlord_, _Archlord_, _Sage_, _Herald_, and _Monarch_. Each rank of power unlocks specific abilities, with Archlord, Sage, Herald, and Monarch all being ranks that are more frequent to be able to ascend Cradle.

To understand the ranks of Sage, Herald, and Monarch we must take a minute to understand what we mean by an "Archlord":

Archlords or Archladies, are sacred artists who have passed into the "Lord" realm. They have access to _Soulfire_, a purified form of Vital Aura with no impurities or imperfections. The process of ascending from Truegold to Underlord involves the sacred artist's body being bathed in Soulfire, cleansing and repairing their body and spirit. Soulfire also allows for sacred artists to manipulate other sources of vital aura. This interplay is one of the first steps to becoming an Sage, Herald, or Monarch.

Archlord are different from their other Lord realm counterparts in that other than prodigies Archlords tend to be much older, with a stronger and more developed will. The continued and practiced use of soulfire to affect sources of vital aura develops their wills over time to the point where they become an almost manifestable item. 

Heralds tend to be Archlords who have used their considerable will to merge their physical body with their _Remnant_ &ndash; the manifestation of their spirit. Doing this allows the Herald to switch between physical and spiritual forms. With their will focused inwards it also makes Heralds incredibly powerful beings, capable of perfect control of the flow of their madra through their body. This perfect control means that Heralds hit hard; both physically and metaphysically.

Sages instead focus their will outward to the world at large, creating workings directly on reality. This is done through the authority of _Icons_ to touch the Way. It is a spiritual power that which signifies a greater concept of reality. The Strength Icon can symbolize many things such as raw physical power, emotional strength, or martial prowess, but the sacred artists who operate under its authority all end up with greater ability and control over power. Sages also traditionally have two titles: one for the icon they manifested, and the other for the name of their path. For example, prior to his ascension Ozriel was known as the Broom Sage as he had manifested the Broom Icon; and by the "Sage of the Hollow King." Similarly Wei Shi Lindon Arelius was known as the "Void Sage" or the "Sage of Twin Stars."

Monarchs are the rarest stage of advancement on Cradle, with only a handful at a time ever existing due to certain limitations of the iteration. In theory a Monarch is simple: it is a sacred artist who is ***both*** a Sage and a Herald. Their rarity is also a result of the will power that makes an Archlord become either a Sage or Herald to begin with. Since Heralds focus their will power inward it becomes hard for them to connect with an external icon. In order for Sages to combine with their remnants they must bend their remnant to their will, but Sage remnants gain their own connection and authority with the sacred artist's given icons so this becomes a fight that that Sage may end up losing.
