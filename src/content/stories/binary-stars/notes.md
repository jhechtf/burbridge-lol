## Basics

1. Main group of 5
2. Each of their paths is "Path of the [Something] Star"
3. Would like for the first Sage and first Herald to be brothers (twins) that end up sitting on opposite sides.
    - their personalities should be such that the advancement to herald and sage are due to how they view the world,
    and their place in it. 
    - meaning one brother views the world as bending to their will (the 'good' one) and the other views their will
    as the main force to move the world.

Since this would be before the first person to ascend, this would mean that calling it "Cradle" won't make a lot of sense.
Therefore, the denizens in this age will call the world Tsuchi.

## Location

Where the actual fuck are we?

I think we do this on the Everwood continent, but I suppose we'll see as the story starts to go.

## Paths


### Path of the Bleeding Star

<dl>
  <dt>Madra Types</dt>
  <dd>Blood, Light</dd>

  <dt>Light Madra Aspects</dt>
  <dd>Light - Some techniques use the light aspect to mask the actual attack coming towards them</dd>
  <dd>Fast - Light do be fast. Techniques utilize this aspect to make it.<dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    The Path of Bleeding Star is a path of necessity. It combines two frequent Madra aspects found in arid climates. Between raiders
    and just the fight for resource, there is ample light and blood aura. This does not mean it's sacred artists should be 
    underestimated in anyway; practitioners of the Path fo the Bleeding Star can become some of the most dangerous sacred artists
    known to Tsuchi.

  <dt>Common Goldsigns</dt>
  <dd>Lines of blood-colored madra from the corners of their eyes</dd>
  <dd>A pale blood-colored that runs up a user's hands up to just above their wrists and lower legs to roughly mid shin.</dd>
  <dd>A collar of blood around their neck.</dd>
</dl>

#### Techniques

##### Bleeding Star

**Type**: Ruler

The namesake technique of the Path of the Bleeding Star

The SA stars with taking control of any light in the area. While the light is arrested, and an eerie twilight hazes the battlefield
the SA takes control of any blood aura on the battle field; the blood of any corpses, blood from wounds in soldiers, and 
even the blood within other SAs as well. The SA then combines the blood with the light, effectively creating bombs in an area
made of blood traveling at insane speeds. This combination with light creates a crimson glow around the SA.

##### Crimson Star

**Type**: Enforcer

Pushing light and blood madra through their body, the SA becomes much faster and heals from otherwise fatal wounds.

##### Ray of Blood

**Type**: Striker

Strike out with Blood madra, using light madra to speed up the rate of travel

##### Desolate Throne

**Type**: Ruler

The SA takes control of a vast amount of light aura, and pushes it out. The lack of light being absorbed creates a 
cold zone where temperatures plummet exponentially without an external heat source (e.g. a fire sacred artist)

## Madra

Notes about Madra aspects

### Blood

life-giving
forged blood madra could have aspects of metal, since there's iron in the blood?


### Light

Light madra, obvious has aspects of illumination. but Light has many aspects beyond that, depending on how technical
we want to get, and how technical we can expect the world of ancient Cradle to be. A prospective "scientist" on Cradle
would likely have one of two stances on the nature of light (and therefore light madra): It is a small piece of something
going so fast it cannot be seen, but so small that it's abatement doesn't cause a crater's worth of damage; or a wave,
like ripples in a pond during the rain.

... conduit for energy? (i.e. that light is warm?); could we make it for e=mc^2?

### Shadow

Shadows are voids where light should've been. A nothingness, where things may hide. 

It is also peaceful; Soundless, lightless, alone.

Shadows are not an opposite, but an absence. Atheism is not the opposite of theism, it is a lack of it. Not believing in gods
is not the same thing as actively campaigning against gods.

### Force

Push. Pull. Flail. Strike. Stab. Attempted Motion. 

### Death

An eventuality, especially for people at the time where the non-aging ranks of Sage and Herald have yet to be discovered.
In this Cradle, it is known that while it may take centuries, all things must be returned to Death.

Death madra damages the life madra inside people.

### Earth

Earth madra is steady, unchanging. It is inertia

### Jade Cycling Techniques

When a user gets to Jade (or before, as Lindon learns the HaEPW before hand IIRC) they end up learning a cycling technique that helps
to improve some aspect of their sacred arts to accentuate their path. These are some ideas for the different techniques.

#### Hell's Gate 

The Hell's Gate cycling technique is useful for paths that use multiple aspects of madra in order to allow only one type of
madra to go through a user's channels. It is seen as putting a gate in front of the cycling madra of a special "color" or "shape"
such that only that specific madra can get through. Part of the struggle of this technique is that different madra types 
move at slightly different speeds, so in order to keep the madra from "back filling" a SA's channels you have to make sure
you still spin your core fast enough that the block never backs up to the other side of the blockade.

This can make a path of two or three aspects, such as wind, water, and lightning, utilize techniques of single or double
(if SA is adept enough) attributes such as wind + water, water and lightning, wind and lightning. 

The willful slowing of madra has a noticeable (but not as strong as HaEPW) effect of increasing core size the more it is practiced.
Cycling technique is named because the process of practicing this is horrific, and can cause immense pain in SAs if they restrict
the flow too much. Many were quoted as saying "this is like pushing my madra through hell's gate." which felt a fitting name.

## Iron Bodies

Perfect Iron Bodies are acquired when moving from copper to Iron, and with specific conditions can help improve a path's
ability to perform it's desired goals. Lindon uses a more thorough variation of the Bloodborn Iron Body, which helps him heal faster.
Yerin uses Steelborn Iron Body, which increases her strength as she goes up through ranks.

We put these things here to keep track in case we think of anything particularly cool.

## Goldsigns

Goldsigns are one of the variable things in Cradle, and I'll try to jot down my thoughts on what I think shapes the form a Remnant takes
when absorbed into the soul of a sacred artist.

We know that Remnants are manifestations of the soul, and that techniques can be engrained onto the soul such that the remnant is able to
perform those techniques as well. Similarly, with Dreadbests we see bindings in the corpses since Dreadbeasts do not leave remnants.

I think that the shape a goldsign takes is determined by the technique most engrained in a soul / remnant. This simultaneously reflects in the form
the remnant takes, as well as what Goldsign is made afterwards. Below are some examples I can think of that sort of prove my theory

1. Jai Long took in a remnant of a branch path, who didn't practice the same version as his. This meant that the remnant
had a binding that differed from his own, and thus affected its final form as a goldsign when absorbed. Every other practitioner of his same path
had the steel helmet hair thing. That's because those people took in the remnant of someone on that same path, who were trained the same way.
This meant that they had the same technique bound into their soul.
2. Not every practioner of the same _type_ of path has the same Goldsign, meaning it's not a "fire", "water", or "whatever" madra thing.
We see plenty of Akura, who all have various (though shadowy) Goldsigns. Mercy has the gloves, Pride has the "tattoos",
