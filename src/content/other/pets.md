They'll say to not be sad.

For they were "Just a pet"

But we know the truth in the words

couldn't be farther yet

<br />

still people will try

to save the sting of

when your pet will die.

<br />

They'll have joined you one day

many years passed it's been.

not so many you'd never remember

but so many now you'd love to live again.

<br />

The signs sneak up on you,

your eyes always seeing their younger self.

But soon you realize,

they need so much more of your help.

<br />

A part of you they've been to you

but their all you've been to them

it's hard to see the signs

through all your love

<br />

Of your pet's Inevitble Goodbye
